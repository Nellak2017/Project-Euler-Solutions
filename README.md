# Project-Euler-Solutions
I am a hobbyist that loves to solve programming puzzles, I have made efficient Python code to solve many Project Euler Problems.

Every program was written from scratch, and the only libraries used are the ones that were hand crafted. If there is a mathematical shortcut for a problem, it will be in the comments to justify the solution.
