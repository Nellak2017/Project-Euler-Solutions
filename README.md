# Project-Euler-Solutions
Efficient Python algorithms for Project Euler Problems.
Python code for many Project Euler problems.

Every program was written from scratch, and the only libraries used are the ones that were hand crafted. If there is a mathematical shortcut for a problem, it will be in the comments to justify the solution.
